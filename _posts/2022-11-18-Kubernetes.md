Kubernetes is an open-source platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a unified way of deploying, scaling, and operating applications across different infrastructure environments, such as on-premises data centers, public clouds, etc.

<h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
I propose you k8s HA cluster using Rancher on the VMware cluster Platform.
ESXi is a popular virtualization platform that allows you to run multiple virtual machines on a single physical host. By creating an ESXi cluster with multiple physical hosts, you can pool resources and provide high availability for your virtual machines. This ensures that your applications remain available even if one or more hosts fail.
Rancher is a popular choice for deploying and managing Kubernetes clusters on VMware ESXi clusters as it provides a user-friendly interface for k8s cluster management, including a centralized dashboard for monitoring cluster health and performance. It also supports advanced Kubernetes features like automatic scaling, service discovery, and load balancing, making it a good choice for high-availability deployments.
With Rancher, you can easily deploy a Kubernetes cluster with multiple control plane nodes and worker nodes, ensuring that your cluster remains available even in the event of node failures. Additionally, Rancher also provides robust backup and disaster recovery features, ensuring that your data is protected and can be easily restored in the event of a failure. 
Furthermore, you can use the VMware ESXi cluster to create both traditional virtual machines as well as Kubernetes virtual machines. The VMware ESXi cluster provides a virtualized infrastructure that allows you to create, manage, and run multiple virtual machines on the same physical hardware. This can include running Kubernetes virtual machines alongside traditional virtual machines, as long as the underlying hardware and resources are for workloads.
Following is the proposed Hardware that will be used for the VMware ESXI cluster for further k8s deployment.
